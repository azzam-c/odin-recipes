        <p><h2>Linguini, a type of pasta originating from Italy, is known for its long, flat shape that resembles fettuccine but is narrower. 
            The name "linguini" translates to "little tongues" in Italian, reflecting its unique shape. 
            This pasta is traditionally made from durum wheat and water, resulting in a firm texture that holds up well to various sauces.</h2></p>
